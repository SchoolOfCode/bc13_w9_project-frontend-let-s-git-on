# THE ICE MELTER APP

<i>The Ice Melter App is an app is a new take on the
conventional ice breaker appraoch, it's designed to help
bootcampers connect better and more comfortably with 
their new pairs. It takes the bootcamper through a
series of fun questions which later can be discussed 
and perhaps debated with their pair at the end. All you 
need is your pairs ID then debate away.</i><br/>

<br/><b><h1 style="font-style: bold; font-size: 15px;">The Problem?</h1></b>
<i>Meeting new partners for the week can be nerve racking,
sometimes you don't know what to say, sometimes their are
awkward moments and sometimes you are tired of reintroducing
yourself to someone new each week. Is there a better way of
breaking the ice with a new partner?</i><br/>

<i>Introduce a new way of geeting to know you new weekly pair,
create an app that facilitates bonding through a fun 
activity and discussing your answers, learn more about 
your partner.</i>
