# THE ICE MELTER APP

<i>The Ice Melter App is an app is a new take on the
conventional ice breaker appraoch, it's designed to help
bootcampers connect better and more comfortably with 
their new pairs. It takes the bootcamper through a
series of fun questions which later can be discussed 
and perhaps debated with their pair at the end. All you 
need is your pairs ID then debate away.</i><br/>

activity and discussing your answers, learn more about 
your partner.</i>
